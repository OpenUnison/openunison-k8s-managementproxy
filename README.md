The management proxy exposes a cluster's API server without having to get the cluster's Certificate Authority to issue you a certificate or to use a static `ServiceAccount`.  The proxy relies on the same security used by API servers that integrate with OpenID Connect, relying on the security of the identity provider.  When deployed with OpenUnison's Orchestra Login Portal, this proxy provides a secure mechanism for multi-cluster self service management.

# Deployment


## What You Need To Start

Prior to deploying Orchestra you will need:

1. Kubernetes 1.10 or higher
2. The Nginx Ingress Controller deployed (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)
3. The issuer URL for your OpenUnison Orchestra Portal.  This is usually `https://hostname/auth/idp/remotek8s`
5. helm 3.0+


## Add Tremolo Security's Helm Repo

```
helm repo add tremolo https://nexus.tremolo.io/repository/helm/
helm repo update
```

## Deploy The OpenUnison Operator

Create your namespace
```
kubectl create ns ou-mgmt-proxy
```

Deploy the operator
```
helm install openunison tremolo/openunison-operator --namespace ou-mgmt-proxy
```

Wait for the operator pod to be available
```
watch kubectl get pods -n ou-mgmt-proxy
```

## Create A Secret For Your OpenID Connect Secret

Create a secret in the `openunison` namespace:

```
apiVersion: v1
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: orchestra-secrets-source
  namespace: ou-mgmt-proxy
data:
  unisonKeystorePassword: aW0gYSBzZWNyZXQ=
kind: Secret
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| unisonKeystorePassword | The password for OpenUnison's keystore, should NOT contain an ampersand (`&`) |



## Deploy OpenUnison

Copy `values.yaml` (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenUnison/helm-charts/master/openunison-k8s-login-oidc/values.yaml) and update as appropriate:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| services.api_server_host | The host name the proxy will be accessible by.  This host name must be accessible by your Orchestra Portal cluster. |
| services.issuer_url | The URL for Orchestra remote management OpenID Connect identity provider.  Generally `https://orchestrahost/auth/idp/remotek8s` |
| services.enable_tokenrequest | If true, the OpenUnison pods will use the TokenRequestAPI instead of static `ServiceAccount` tokens.  This is a good risk mitigation tool as these tokens expire every ten minutes and are not stored in your cluster's etcd database |
| services.token_request_audience | When using the TokenRequestAPI, the audience to request tokens for. |
| services.token_request_expiration_seconds | Number of seconds tokens are valid, minimum of 600 (10 minutes) |
| cert_template.ou | The `OU` attribute for the forward facing certificate |
| cert_template.o | The `O` attribute for the forward facing certificate |
| cert_template.l | The `L` attribute for the forward facing certificate |
| cert_template.st | The `ST` attribute for the forward facing certificate |
| cert_template.c | The `C` attribute for the forward facing certificate |
| certs.use_k8s_cm  | Tells the deployment system if you should use k8s' built in certificate manager.  If your distribution doesn't support this (such as Canonical and Rancher), set this to false |
| image | The name of the image to use |
| monitoring.prometheus_service_account | The prometheus service account to authorize access to the /monitoring endpoint |
| network_policies.enabled | If `true`, the chart will generate `NetworkPolicy` objects that limit access to the OpenUnison pods.  This is a good option to enable to minimize the services in your cluster that can access the OpenUnison pods and their `ServiceAccount` tokens.
| network_policies.ingress.enabled | If `true`, a `NetworkPolicy` is created to allow traffic from the `Ingress` controller's `Namespace`.  If enabling `NetworkPolicy` generation this should be set to `true` |
| network_policies.ingress.labels | List of labels the ingress `Namespace` uses to allow access. |
| network_policies.monitoring.enabled | If `true`, a `NetworkPolicy` is created to allow traffic from the cluster's Prometheus for monitoring.  If enabling `NetworkPolicy` and using Prometheus this should be set to `true` |
| network_policies.monitoring.labels | List of labels the monitoring `Namespace` uses to allow access. ***NOTE*** : By default, the `monitoring` namespace generated by `kube-prometheus` has no labels, so you'll need to add one |


Additionally, you can add your Orchestra Portal's TLS base64 encoded PEM certificate to your values under `trusted_certs` for `pem_b64`.  This will allow OpenUnison to talk to your portal using TLS if it doesn't use a commercially signed certificate.  If you don't need a certificate to talk to your identity provider, replace the `trusted_certs` section with `trusted_certs: []`.

Finally, run the helm chart:

`helm install management-proxy tremolo/openunison-k8s-management --namespace ou-mgmt-proxy -f /path/to/values.yaml`

## Adding The New Cluster to Orchestra

Use the helm chart to add your new cluster to Orchestra.
